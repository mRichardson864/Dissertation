# Dissertation
The file "Dissertation_collecting_data.ipynb" contains the code to convert the data from the public dataset into a list of tweet IDs and then collate these hydrated IDs together in a single .feather file

The file "Dissertation_Load_and_Display_Data" Loads in the .feather file created and contains the functions to calculate the average sentiment score for each day in a data range as well as the functions to use the SpaCy PhraseMatcher. 

All other code created for testing purposes, see Chapter 4 of the Dissertation, and not required for the final experiment can be found in "Dissertation_Chapter4"

The data for all the downloaded tweets (.feather file format) from the dataset in April 2020 can be found here (https://www.dropbox.com/s/ap29ociuezlk8qa/all_april.feather?dl=0)
