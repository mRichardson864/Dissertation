The file "Dissertation_collecting_data.ipynb" contains the code to convert the data from the public dataset into a list of tweet IDs and then collate these hydrated IDs together in a single .feather file

The file "Dissertation_Load_and_Display_Data" Loads in the .feather file created and contains the functions to calculate the average sentiment score for each day in a data range as well as the functions to use the SpaCy PhraseMatcher.
